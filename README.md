## **Description**
For the part of the endpoint search I used query params which are:

**URL?page={}&limit={}sort={name}&order={ASC|DESC}&{type}={value}&gender={value}...&{attribute}={value}**

The values page and limit have values by defect if it don't pass it for params. The page will be 0 and limit 100.

## **Examples of the endpoint search**
By name, sorted alphabetically
> **URL/api/v1/pets?sort=name&order=ASC**

By pet type (cat, dog, etc) sorting by date
> **URL/api/v1/pets?sort={id|created_at}&order=DESC&type={typeId}**

By gender and type (female dog) sorting by date, most recent to least recent.
> **URL/api/v1/pets?sort={id|created_at}&order=DESC&gender=female&type={typeId}**
